## Acknowledgements

REPL implementation with minor modification thanks to DeanPDX (see https://github.com/DeanPDX/sql-fileizer/)

## Demonstrations

### Reverse Palindrome

This command demonstrates reversing a user input string and identifying if the string is a palindrome.

### Substring

Demonstrates utilizing nested loops to identify all substrings of user input string. Also demonstrates utilizing
post-incrementing vs pre-incrementing.

### String Every Other Character

Demonstrates displaying every other character in a string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', then the same in reverse.

### Char to Numeric

Demonstrates multiple methods for converting a character to numeric value

### Is Prime

Demonstrates method for determining if an integer is a prime number

### Singleton

Demonstrates a singleton design pattern implementation

### Object Array

Demonstrates storing multiple types in an object array and printing their values. Provides explanation of reference and
value types.


### CalculatePi

Demonstrates computing approximation of pi using the Nilakantha series with parallel processing

### Fibonacci Closure

Demonstrates a closure (a function that encapsulates some state) that generates Fibonacci numbers

### Peano inters

Demonstrate Peano integers which are a way to represent natural numbers using a recursive structure.  Each integer is either 0 (Z) or the successor of another Peano integer (S)

### Generate Primes (Work-in-progress)

Generate prime numbers using a concurrent prime sieve approach.  In order to avoid the actual infinite creation I've tried utilizing a timeout, but this is not yet working as I have expected.
